The feature I chose is Interactivity. The one of three regions for hitting mouse to triggle the different animated behavious are
1/3 left of the whole screen, which will move the "can" exhibit up and down if mouse is pressed and drag up and down in that region. 
And the rest screen on the right is divided into top part and bottom part.
Press mouse and drag horizontally in top part will control exhibit rotate horizontally.
Press mouse and drag vertically in  bottom part will control exhibit rotate vertically.
